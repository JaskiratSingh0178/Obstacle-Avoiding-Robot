# Obstacle-Avoiding-Robot

An autonomous robotic car capable of detecting and avoiding obstacles in its path using sensors and microcontroller programming. This project combines hardware and software to create a smart, self-navigating vehicle.

**Overview:**
This project demonstrates:
- **Real-Time Obstacle Avoidance:** The car uses ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles and change its course.
- Microcontroller Control: Powered by **Arduino Uno**, the car processes sensor input and executes motor control commands.
- Modular Design: The system is modular, making it easy to replicate or improve.

**Technology Used:**
- **Hardware:**
  - Ultrasonic Sensor (e.g., HC-SR04)
  - Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino Uno)
  - Motor Driver Module (e.g., L298N)
  - DC Motors and Wheels
  - Power Supply

- **Software:**
  - Arduino IDE for programming

**Features:**
- Automatic obstacle detection and avoidance
- Simple yet robust design
- Modular and extensible framework
